# Mapty
Mapty is an app that allows the user to log their workouts i.e they can input the physical location where the workout took place, the type of exercise (running or cycling), distance, elevation gain (for cycling), steps/min(for walking) etc.

Used the geolocation API and Leaflet library to display the map at the user's current location. The user clicks on the map to add a new workout. Below is a screenshot of the UI.
